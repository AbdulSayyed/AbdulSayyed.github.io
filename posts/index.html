<p>Understanding Sources of information</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="err">- Sources of Information are commonly categorized as "Primary" or "Secondary" depending upon their emergence and originality and work done on them.</span>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A <strong>Primary</strong> source is a first hand account of an event or a thing which includes original material e.g., a discovery of a site or an object or an unusual event containing some information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While <strong>Secondary</strong> source is based upon Primary source so the research is done on Primary material to come up with some conclusions of what happened or what would have happened etc.</p>

<h4>Primary Research</h4>
<ul>
<li>There are three types of primary research specifically commissioned for the problem at hand<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Qualitative </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Quantitative</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Experimental</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Qualitative Research</h5>
<ul>
<li>It is about understanding decision-making</li>
<li>It is about one's feelings, urge or deep desires</li>
<li>It is about uncovering the key to either a problem or a solution</li>
<li>To access the hidden information,find out what drives one to do something</li>
</ul>
<h5>Quantitative Research</h5>
<ul>
<li>It is all about dealing with data, numbers and statistics</li>
<li>It is about measuring unmeasurable so it can be quantified and used in representation.</li>
<li>It is about scaling feelings / emotions on the scale of e.g., 1 ..2...3....10</li>
</ul>
<h6>Comparison</h6>
<ul>
<li>In quantitative survey questions are asked exactly the same way and in the same order while qualitative research uses a less structured discussion guide. A  set of discussion topics with open-ended questions and probes that lead to the discussion. As a result, the moderator / experimenter can easily  push respondents / participants  to reflect and explore their feelings, perceptions, and behaviours. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Expectations: </p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="err">+ A student and specially foreign student should adapt to an academic style thinking, leaving other preconceived notions aside, showing skills and talent in a way that is more acceptable in scientific socities.</span>
</code></pre>


</blockquote>
<h4>Writing an Essay</h4>
<p>To be able to write a technical piece of scientific research one should know the difference between different type of <strong>Essays</strong>. For example there is a difference between writing with emotions for the betterment of humanity and writing for the science and social sciences.</p>
<h5>Difficulties faced by students</h5>
<ul>
<li>Grasping the question, the need to write and making logical and visible structure to guide them along in process of writing.</li>
<li>Dealing with Grammar and Punctuations and also sticking to rules.</li>
<li>Not making a habit of writing in same style.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Is writing an Essay a skill you learn or you are born with ?</h5>
<p>Undoubtedly we all differs in what we can do, children born in a same family seems to be doing good in different areas. Similarly one of us may write better than others depending on  educational backgrounds but having said that it is not like an abnormal difference in cognition or in special activity in neural pathways on the contrary it is an art / skill  that can be learnt just like a sport. It requires your interest, your concentrated effort and your focused single mindedness. It goes like this, <strong>The more you use it the better it gets</strong> so it acts like a human muscle. </p>
<p>Students who do not seem to do well in this area may need to look at their innate behaviour. In order to make things work, sometimes machine needs tuning. This tuning of machine is to <a href="../Add/ref/to/examples"> change one's habits </a> which involves two main aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>First is to be aware of your own action and reaction.</li>
<li>Consciously swapping the usual response. </li>
</ol>
<p>Once something is done consciously it remains in working and as well as in long term memory compare to things which are done unconsciously on auto-mode. If you are asked to answer this question <code>How many times did you drink water yesterday?</code> First you will be surprised to learn this question and shrug your shoulder and say <code>who cares?</code></p>
<p>The key to the problem lies here !  <code>Who cares!</code>. We do not tend to care things which are already on auto-pilot. For example our pattern like <code>breathing, walking, involuntarily movement of body parts, sleeping</code> and so on. This list goes on and on and also differs from one person to another. As we all gather many things from our environment over the years advertently or inadvertently. </p>
<p>The normal person can not be bothered about drinking a glass of water and would reply to the question as <code>who cares</code> compare to the one who already know the importance of drinking enough water as a sport person. When a patient who is suffering from the kidney pain is made aware of the fact that the kidneys need more water. Once he is consciously accepted / registered this information, he would care about drinking water making sure that he/she drinks more than required minimum amount. Many times a person who usually drinks a can of coke after a meal would stop and swap it with a glass of water or some other beneficial liquid or a juice. This conscious change comes after being aware of the problems.</p>
<p>Thus for a student who is facing difficulty of writing an structured essay need to be aware of the shortcomings and </p>
<h4>Referencing Tools</h4>
<p>A software used for the purpose of incorporating references in an essay , research paper or in dissertation and in Phd thesis is often known as by the following name:</p>
<ol>
<li>Referencing software</li>
<li>Refraining tools</li>
<li>Reference Management Software</li>
<li>Citation software and so on</li>
</ol>

<p>The techniques are known as <code>soft skills</code> and are improved like other skills, most jobs require a <code>psychologist</code> to have an <code>Evaluation skills</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All clinical / counselling work is done using Qualitative Research</p>
</li>
<li>There are three main techniques</li>
<li><a href="https://bizfluent.com/info-8580000-six-types-qualitative-research.html">Taken from bizfluent</a></li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Phenomenological Model
    <code>Describing how any one participant experiences a specific event is the goal of the phenomenological method of research. This method utilizes interviews, observation and surveys to gather information from subjects. Phenomenology is highly concerned with how participants feel about things during an event or activity. Businesses use this method to develop processes to help sales representatives effectively close sales using styles that fit their personality.</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ethnographic Model
    <code>The ethnographic model is one of the most popular and widely recognized methods of qualitative research; it immerses subjects in a culture that is unfamiliar to them. The goal is to learn and describe the culture's characteristics much the same way anthropologists observe the cultural challenges and motivations that drive a group. This method often immerses the researcher as a subject for extended periods of time. In a business model, ethnography is central to understanding customers. Testing products personally or in beta groups before releasing them to the public is an example of ethnographic research.</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grounded Theory Model
    <code>The grounded theory method tries to explain why a course of action evolved the way it did. Grounded theory looks at large subject numbers. Theoretical models are developed based on existing data in existing modes of genetic, biological or psychological science. Businesses use grounded theory when conducting user or satisfaction surveys that target why consumers use company products or services. This data helps companies maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty.</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Case Study Model
    <code>Unlike grounded theory, the case study model provides an in-depth look at one test subject. The subject can be a person or family, business or organization, or a town or city. Data is collected from various sources and compiled using the details to create a bigger conclusion. Businesses often use case studies when marketing to new clients to show how their business solutions solve a problem for the subject.</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Historical Model
    <code>The historical method of qualitative research describes past events in order to understand present patterns and anticipate future choices. This model answers questions based on a hypothetical idea and then uses resources to test the idea for any potential deviations. Businesses can use historical data of previous ad campaigns and the targeted demographic and split-test it with new campaigns to determine the most effective campaign.</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Narrative Model
    <code>The narrative model occurs over extended periods of time and compiles information as it happens. Like a story narrative, it takes subjects at a starting point and reviews situations as obstacles or opportunities occur, although the final narrative doesn't always remain in chronological order. Businesses use the narrative method to define buyer persona to identify innovations that appeal to a target market.</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software use in Qualitative Data Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are loads of software used in this area a google search will give an idea about used software in market.</li>
<li>Udemy has a cours of <a href="https://www.udemy.com/qualitative-data-analysis-using-maxqda/">using  MAXQDA</a> software which uses mixed model i.e., Qualitative and Quntitative  and mixed mode </li>
</ul>
<h4>Methods in Researcdh</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ontology</li>
<li>Epistemology</li>
<li>Methodology</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You need to understant these term and how they apply to research.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When these methods are clearly understood and critically evaluated it helps student to </p>
<ul>
<li>Stay competent</li>
<li>Make better decission</li>
<li>Keep client safe</li>
<li>enable you to decide what should be applied to your practice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ontology</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a term used for beliefs about reality</li>
<li>Different kind of study is based upon different beliefs about what we think truth is.<ul>
<li>Does Truth really exist?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What we think reality is, shapes/ has shaped / will shape what we think we can find out about reality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus in order to discover something / find out about something we need to first start change our thinking pattern towards it.</p>
<p>In other words our perception of <code>Truth</code> influences what we think we can discover / find out / we can know</p>
<p>Similarly our pre conceived notion influences our thinking consequtively influences the discovery / findings or / knowing / knowledge</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>There are two types of Ontology and they are opposites</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Realism and Relativism</p>
<ul>
<li>Realists believe that only one truth exists. It is either dark or bright. In essence they believe black is only black and there are no shades of black or white.</li>
<li>Therefore Realist believe that <code>Truth</code> exist and it can not be changed. It is discovered using <code>objective measurements</code>.</li>
<li>
<p>If you belong to this group of realist and have this view about the reality then this view always influences the researcher every decision is made in the study.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relativism, it is an opposite view of realism</p>
<ul>
<li>Relativist believe in existence of multiple realities</li>
<li>What is real is shaped by the context or meaning you attached to it</li>
<li>Truth does not exist without meaning</li>
<li>Reality is created by how we see things, thus it evolves and changes depending on experience</li>
<li>And if it is context bound it can not be generalized instead it can only be transferred to other similar context</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h4>How nikola works</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is a python static site generator that used help from other existing site generators such as hugo and pelican. It has number of small pulgins that do the jobs. <a href="https://plugins.getnikola.com/">Here</a> is the list of plug in that it uses.</li>
<li>For example <code>notebook_shortcode</code> is a plug in that allows embedding the notebook into the markdown files. But be careful, it may not work and distrub your settings.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Installing Nikola</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a Python virtual environment.</li>
<li>Either create or choose your working directory, I created <code>mkdir -p nikola</code> in my project.</li>
<li>Cd into nikola, activate your virtual environment </li>
<li>Install nikola using pip with extras <code>pip install nikola[extras]</code>. On windows it takes time.</li>
<li>Check the version <code>nikola version</code>. I have <code>v8.1</code>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Initialize nikola</h4>
<ol>
<li>Run <code>$ nikola init --quiet sayyedblogs</code>. This will create a new directoy name <code>sayyedblogs</code> and create the following directories and one file. <code>conf.py  files/  galleries/  images/  listings/  pages/  posts/</code>.</li>
<li>All these directories are empty. The file <code>conf.py</code> comes with default installation options available.</li>
<li>Get the help run <code>nikola --help</code>
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Start the server</h4>
<ul>
<li>Though we have not put any of our contents yet we can start the server <code>nikola serve --browser</code>. It starts the browser and serve it on local host port:80000. You can start the server on a different port <code>nikola server -p 2320</code>
</li>
<li>When site is built all configuration files are read from <code>conf.py</code>, we will refer this file as config file hereafter.</li>
<li>By default it uses the many options already set to default values.</li>
<li>Nikola creates a directory named <code>ouput</code> where all files and folders are created that is served to the website.</li>
<li>The landing page is created at the root of the <code>output</code> directroy as <code>index.html</code>. This page is created automatically.</li>
<li>It has three sections:</li>
<li>Html <code>meta-data</code>
</li>
<li>Page <code>nave-bar</code> taken from the theme used</li>
<li>Page contents ( not defined yet)</li>
<li>Bottom script.</li>
<li>Since everything is generated automatically, we are not goingto touch it yet we have to.</li>
<li>By default Nikola uses <code>bootblog4</code> theme, we are going to use a different one.</li>

<h3>An introductory book on Python by Allen <a href="../files/thinkpython2.pdf">Think Python</a>
</h3>
<h3>Languages primitive data</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Variables are primitive data type in Python and are declared without any key word <code>num1 = 100</code> hence Python is said to be <strong>dynamically implicitly typed language</strong> because the type of the variable is defined at run time implicitly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are <strong>Built in data type</strong>: such as <em>numbers { integers, floats, complex numbers}, strings, lists, tuples and dictionaries</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rules for Variable names</h3>
<ul>
<li>The only characters that are allowed are <strong>letters</strong>, <strong>numbers</strong>, and <strong>underscores</strong>. Also, they can't start with numbers.</li>
<li>When declaring variable you don't need a var or Var like other languages, just type the name of the variable and assigned some value to it.</li>
<li>x = 10 her x is a variable which is assigned 10, it can be deleted by using <strong>del</strong> operator.</li>
<li>Many other languages have special operators such as '++' as a short cut for 'x += 1'. Python does not have these.</li>
<li>If a variable is not defined  ( assigned a value) trying to use it will cause an error. ( name is not defined)</li>
<li>a = b = c = 2 , her 2 is assigned to all a, b and c variable.</li>
<li>To see the internal type use <code>print(type(a))</code> you should get // <class int></class>
</li>
<li>int(...), float(...), str(...) is used to cast one type to another type.</li>
<li>Multiple assignment is possible as well</li>
</ul>

<h3>Blocks in other language but indentation in Python</h3>
<ul>
<li>Python uses indentation (white space at the beginning of a line) to delimit blocks of code. Other languages, such as C, use curly braces to accomplish this, but in Python indentation is mandatory; programs won't work without it. As you can see, the statements in the if should be indented.</li>
<li>
<p>An else statement follows an if statement, and contains code that is called when the if statement evaluates to False.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As with if statements, the code inside the block should be indented.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">:</span>
   <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Yes"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
   <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"No"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>


<ul>
<li>The short cut to <code>else if</code> is <code>elif</code>, colon is must and second line must be indented as opposed to curly brackets <code>{</code>
</li>
<li>An if .. elfi ..elif sequence is replacement for the switch or case in other languages. Python does not have <code>swithc, case</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Boolean Logic</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>and</strong>, <strong>or</strong>, <strong>!=</strong> , <strong>&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;</strong> and <strong>not</strong> operators are used</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<code>1 == 1 and 2 == 2</code>  would yield <code>True</code>. In other language instead of <code>and</code> an ampersand sign <code>&amp;</code> is used to represent <code>and</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>not 1 == 1</code>, first <code>1==1</code> is executed then inverted with not.</li>
<li>
<code>if 2!=3:</code> is comparing <code>2 is not equal to 3</code>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>True and False</h4>
<ul>
<li>True and False are special objects in Python. They are of type bool (for Boolean).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Operator Precedence or order of operations</h3>
<ul>
<li>

<ul>
<li>Would you write this if <code>not 1 + 1 == y or x == 4 and 7 == 8:</code> in your code ? The answer is no, not at all because it is not clear. Though if given we can take help from precedence order but the wise thing to do is to write it with clear parentheses so when you see your own code after a month you know exactly what you want.</li>
<li>All comparison operations in Python have the same priority. </li>
<li>So the better way is to write it like <code>not (1+1) == y or (x ==4 and 7==8)</code> or ((1+1) == y) or (....)` depending what is your intention.</li>
<li>Coming back t precedence operator, say we need to solve the following</li>
<li>not 1 + 1 == y or x == 4 and 7 == 8</li>
<li>Step 1: question  to ask which operator has precedence <code>+, == or , and</code><ul>

<h3>While Loops</h3>

<li>in while loop break breaks the loop while continue stop execution and go back to the beginning of while loop.</li>
<li>while statements are another example with an initial test followed by an indented block. Here’s an example where we find the largest Fibonacci number less than 1000:</li>

<ul>
<li>To see the internal type use <code>print(type(a))</code> you should get <code>&lt;class int&gt;</code>

<code>int(...), float(...), str(...)</code> is used to cast one type to another type.</li>

<li>Multiplication : * how many times you want that string to be printed</li>
<li>indexing : string indexing starts with [0], so if <code>name = "Sayyed"</code> then name[2] would yield <code>y</code>
</li>
<li>negative indexing : name[-1] would give the last letter in a string</li>
<li>Slicing: To get the multiple charachter from a string called slicing: name[1:4] would yield Sayyed because a being 1 while e being at index 4,</li>

<h4>String methods</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Strings have lots of interesting methods. In IPython, try tab-complete on a string variable name, followed by a period – e.g. type my_string., followed by the tab key. See also the list of string methods in the Python docs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One interesting method is replace. It returns a new string that is a copy of the input, but replacing instances of one string with another:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>

<ul>
<li>Notice that the original string has not changed (it’s immutable):</li>

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">my_string</span>

</code></pre>


<ul>
<li>Use the split method to break a string into a list of strings. By default, split will split the string at any white space (spaces, tab characters or line breaks):</li>
</ul>

<h4>String formatting</h4>
<ul>
<li>To combine strins and non strings you have converted the non strings to strings</li>
<li>String formatting provides a more powerful way to embed non-strings within strings. String formatting uses a string's format method to substitute a number of arguments in the string.</li>

<h3>Built in Data Structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>List</strong> are enclosesd in square brackets <code>l=[1,2,"Three"]</code> and ordered sequences of objects</li>
<li>
<strong>Tuple</strong> are enclosed in parenthesis <code>t=(1,2,"Three")</code>, they are also ordered objects but are faster than list and can not be changed thus called <code>immutables</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Dicts</strong> are enclosed in curly brackets `d={"a":1, "b":2}</li>
<li>
<strong>Strings</strong> are enclosed in single or double quotation marks,can contain only chrarcters and are built using the <code>set()</code> built in function.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sets</strong> are constuected from unique objects as they can not be duplictated <code>s1=set_a([1,2,3,4])</code> and <code>s2=set_b([2,3,4,5,6])</code> then <code>s1 | s2</code> would yield {1,2,3,4,5,6}. They are mutable.</li>
<li>Union <code>s1 |s2</code>
</li>
<li>Intersection <code>s1 &amp; s2</code>
</li>
<li>Subset <code>s1 &lt; s2</code> # False or True</li>
<li>Difference <code>s1 - s2</code> # {1}</li>
<li>
<p>Symmetric Difference <code>s1 ^ s2</code> # {1,5,6}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Frozensets</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Lists are mutable in python that is they can be changed using index or can be appended</h4>
<ul>
<li>Array are called list in Python which is not an intelligent thing to do. They are also object and used to store an indexed items in indexed list using square brackets with commas.. Same as in array its index starts with zero.</li>
<li>Unlike other languages Python list can be nested and can store heterogeneous data. `things = ["Hello",90,[2.3, 56], 3.89]. To get to the inside list need to use two brackets. things[2][0] should give 2.3</li>
<li>Lists can be added ( concatinated / inserted) and multiplied in the same way as strings.</li>
<li>To check if an item is in a list, the <code>in</code> operator can be used. It returns True if the item occurs one or more times in the list, and False if it doesn't.</li>
<li>Note that the append method does not return the list, it just changes the list in-place. Python returns None from the append method:</li>

<h3>Tuples</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tuples are almost identical to lists. The only significant difference between tuples and lists is that tuples cannot be changed: you cannot add, change, or delete elements from the tuple. Tuples are constructed by a comma operator enclosed in parentheses, for example (a, b, c). A single item tuple must have a trailing comma, such as (d,).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trying to reassign a value in a tuple causes a TypeError.</p>
</li>
<li>Tuples can be created without the parentheses, by just separating the values with commas.`my_one = "1","2","3"</li>
<li>An empty tuple is created using an empty parenthesis pair: <code>tpl = ()</code>
</li>
<li>Tuples are faster than lists, but they cannot be changed.</li>

<li>It is similar to a list, except that you access its values by looking up a key instead of an index. A key can be any string or a number. Dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces e.g. dct = {'key1' : "value1", 'key2' : "value2"}</li>

<h3>Function</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In python a variabl or a funciton must be defined first before it can be used, it is unlike js, but like other strongly typed languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Same as in any other language except <code>def</code> is used instead of <code>function</code> or any language specific identifier. similarly <code>return</code> keyword is used like js.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scoping of variables applies with the block, variable defined in function blocks are local to only that function and are only visible inside the function. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>def key word is used to declare function</p>
</li>
<li>In python, funciton are objects and can be assinged to any variable and passed like an objects as js.</li>
<li>
<p>If an argument passed is a function, then recieving function must know and treat it as a fucniton.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can import a module or object under a different name using the as keyword. This is mainly used when a module or object has a long or confusing name.</p>

</code></pre>


<ul>
<li>
<code>self</code> in Python is equal to <code>this</code>in js and pointer * in c to give a reference to its method to access the variable inside the function.The self parameter is a Python convention. self is the first parameter passed to any class method. Python will use the self parameter to refer to the object being created. </li>
</ul>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>
</code></pre>


<ul>
<li>A constructor method in Python is <code>__init__(self)</code>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Modules and packages</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Modules in Python are simply Python files with the .py extension containing Python definitions and statements. Modules can be handy when you want to use your function in a number of programs without copying its definition into each program. Modules are imported from other modules using the import keyword and the file name without an extension. The first time a module is loaded into a running Python script, it is initialized by executing the code in the module once. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A module is written in a following way and saved in a file say my_module.py then this file is imported in another file,when it is imported it is run once.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="sd">""" documentation string for module my_module</span>
<span class="sd">This module contains hello_world function</span>
<span class="sd">"""</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello_world</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Hello, World! My name is </span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>


<ul>
<li>The idea is same, you define some function in one file, and import the whole module in an other file and use its functionality. If only one method is needed to be imported it can be done by using <code>from ..... import .....</code> where first ... are filled with the module name and the second one is filled with method name.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Built in Module</h4>
<ul>
<li>Python comes with a library of standard modules. Remember that you can use Ctrl + Space after a dot (.) to explore available methods of a module. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Read and Write file</h4>
<ul>
<li>To read file use <code>file = open("filename","r")</code> in read mode. Then read its text using <code>for lines in f.readlines():</code> and then get it printed using print(lines) and then close th stream <code>file.close()</code>
</li>
</ul>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"input.txt"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"r"</span><span class="p">)</span>   <span class="c1"># here we open file "input.txt".

<h3>Range in Python 3 returns a “range object”. It’s like a list, but isn’t quite a list.</h3>

<li>range in Python 3 returns a range object. It is a sequence, and so it is rather like a list [4]. When you use range with one argument, the argument value is the stop index. For example, to make a range object generating the numbers from 0 up to but not including 5:</li>

<h4>Set the start element for range by passing two arguments:</h4>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="err">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_range = range(1, 7)</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_range</span>
<span class="err">range(1, 7)</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt;&gt; list(my_range)</span>
<span class="err">[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</span>
<span class="err">Set the step size with a third argument:</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_range = range(1, 7, 2)</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_range</span>
<span class="err">range(1, 7, 2)</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt;&gt; list(my_range)</span>
<span class="err">[1, 3, 5]</span>
<span class="err">One common use of range is to iterate over a sequence of numbers in a for loop:</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(5):</span>

<span class="err">2</span>
<span class="err">3</span>
<span class="err">4</span>
<span class="err">Sets</span>
<span class="err">Sets are collections of unique elements, with no defined order. Python reserves the right to order set elements in any way it chooses:</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt;&gt; # Only unique elements collected in the set</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_set = set((5, 3, 1, 3))</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_set  </span>
<span class="err">{1, 5, 3}</span>
<span class="err">Because there is no defined order, you cannot index into a set:</span>

<h3>Reusing code</h3>
<ul>
<li>DRY principle : Dont repeat yourself</li>
<li>WET principle : We enjoy typing</li>
</ul>
<h4>Function Calls</h4>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Hello world!"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre>


<h4>Docstrings</h4>
<ul>
<li>(documentation strings) serve a similar purpose to comments, as they are designed to explain code. However, they are more specific and have a different syntax. They are created by putting a multiline string containing an explanation of the function below the function's first line.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="err"> """</span>
<span class="err">  Print a word with an</span>
<span class="err">  exclamation mark following it.</span>
<span class="err">  """</span>
</code></pre>


<h3>Standard library or built-in module</h3>
<ul>
<li>Python standard  library like other languages is installed when Python is installed which contains many useful functions such as string, re, datetime, math, random os, multiprocessing, subproces,socket , email, json, doctest, unittest, pdf, argpares and sys.</li>
<li>It is a very extensive standard library.</li>
<li>Some of the modules in the standard library are written in Python, and some are written in C. Most are available on all platforms, but some are Windows or Unix specific.ly too many. The complete documentation for the standard library is available online at www.python.org</li>
<li>Many third-party Python modules are stored on the Python Package Index (PyPI).</li>
<li>The best way to install these is using a program called pip. </li>
<li>This comes installed by default with modern distributions of Python. If you don't have it, it is easy to install online. Once you have it, installing libraries from PyPI is easy. </li>
<li>Look up the name of the library you want to install, go to the command line (for Windows it will be the Command Prompt), and enter pip install library_name. Once you've done this, import the library and use it in your code.</li>
<li>Using pip is the standard way of installing libraries on most operating systems, but some libraries have prebuilt binaries for Windows. These are normal executable files that let you install libraries with a GUI the same way you would install other programs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<code>None</code> object is used to represent the absence of a value.</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is similar to null in other programming languages. Like other "empty" values, such as 0, [] and the empty string, It is False when converted to a Boolean variable. When entered at the Python console, it is displayed as the empty string.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The None object is returned by any function that doesn't explicitly return anything else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>None is also a special object in Python. By convention, Python often uses None to mean that no valid value resulted from an operation, or to signal that we don’t have a value for a parameter.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Common Python Exceptions</h3>
<ul>
<li>importError: an import fails;</li>
<li>IndexError: a list is indexed with an out-of-range number;</li>
<li>NameError: an unknown variable is used;</li>
<li>SyntaxError: the code can't be parsed properly;</li>
<li>TypeError: a function is called on a value of an inappropriate type;</li>
<li>ValueError: a function is called on a value of the correct type, but with an inappropriate value.</li>
<li>
</li>
<li>To handle exceptions, and to call code when an exception occurs, you can use a <strong>try/except</strong> statement.</li>
<li>
</li>
<li>The try block contains code that might throw an exception. If that exception occurs, the code in the try block stops being executed, and the code in the except block is run. If no error occurs, the code in the except block doesn't run.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A try statement can have multiple different <code>except</code> blocks to handle different exceptions. Multiple exceptions can also be put into a single except block using parentheses, to have the except block handle all of them.</p>
</li>
<li>Try catch finlly is also availale in python, in fact another version is present </li>
<li>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Raising Exception</h4>
<ul>
<li>An exception can be raised forcefully by using <code>raise</code> command as raise(ValueError)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assertion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Programmers often place assertions at the start of a function to check for valid input, and after a function call to check for valid output.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Numbers</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are two types of numbers in Python: integer and floating point. In Python, an integer is an object of type int, and a float is an object of type float.</li>
